# Comp359-GraphColouring
A Group project with Joel Algera, Brayden Schneider, Alexander Calderon, and Jacob Thompson for our course on design and analysis of algorithms

We were tasked with creating a Naive (non-minimal colour) graph colouring algorithm for planar graphs, where no neighbouring nodes can share the same colour. 

Our Current Scope:
- Research the possibility of converting drawn 2d maps into planar graphs
- Create a colouring algorithm implementing techniques like arc consistency, cut-sets, and variable elimination, which searches for the minimal colour use
- Produce a user-friendly GUI to present algorithm runtime

In this project, we hope to learn more about the proposed graph search methods, explore the variations in algorithm complexity following each strategy's application, and experiment with the validity of the 4-colour theorem.

Initial 6 Graphs (Hand drawn) - Each graph has increasing complexity

Note - All these graphs G1-G6 are initialized in the Graph_Initialization.py file.
